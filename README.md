# UWPChip8

Working Chip-8 interpreter / emulator running under the Universal Windows Platform with Win2D

Note that this does not include any Chip-8 ROMs. These can be had from : http://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html

Demonstrates the CanvasAnimatedControl update cycle and drawing pixels as rectangles with DrawRectangle as well as picking files with FileOpenPicker. This does not demonstrate rendering to a bitmap however I may add this later; due to the low resolution output from the 'CPU' this does not tend to yield great results when scaled.

Pull requests are always welcome.
